# JavaVetProgram
Program to simulate Vet Office Procedures

I wrote this program during the course of my Java Programming class which took the most dedication
out of any project I had ever built.

The files that contain the code for this project will be in the src folders.

A Gson download is also required from Google as this program utilizes a form of Json as Gson.
